The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).


## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Status bar flickering

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Save/Load game

- Cache map geometry for faster reload (100ms instead of seconds for large maps)
- Map progress (time, kill count, etc.) can be displayed in HUD

### Changed

- increase FOV min/max (just for fun)
- More DOOM-like light diminishing (linear fall off)
- 20-25% performance improvement through: simpler sprite state machine, animated walls/flats in shader, change line data structure
- use pixelated images as much as possible. Feels more like DOOM

### Fixed

- BFG was not always hitting objects when player was close to ledge
- Initial position of decorations was not correct
- Do not loop music on wad launch screen

- Texture alignment in some maps
- Apply velocity when exiting pusher floors

## [0.11.0] - 2026-01-22
This is a kind of large release. It's been brewing on and off (mostly off) for a year so this list may be incomplete.

### Added
- Home screen split into play/wads/setting.
- Home screen now has "recently played maps" section to help pickup progress (no save games support yet!)

- 2-click Freedoom installation for new users
- ENDOOM support
- Support for most BOOM lindefs (still missing some pushers, sky transfers, and friction) also MUSINFO
- Some light diminishing. We don't use COLORMAP so it's not accurate but it's still a visual improvement

- Support for ["ghost" monsters](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ghost_monster)

### Changed
- Upgrade to Svelte 5 and Threlte 8.

### Fixed
- Sound propagation bug (TNT)
- Arch-Vile no longer appears to move while resurrecting enemies
- Fix objects teleporting on top of each other

## [0.10.0] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- [Property transfer linedefs](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Linedef_type#Property_transfer). Not including palette change but otherwise it should _just work_.

- Improved tracking and for isometric camera. Players can now see the whole map.
- Use Blockmap for collision detection and [many other performance improvements](https://www.lloydmarkle.com/quieter-life/2025/doom-perf-part-3/):
    - Reduce memory usage by moving away from svelte stores in core logic
    - Use Maps and Sets to speed up map load and map queries
    - Faster monster move checks when in a crowd

### Fixed
- BFG tracers not hitting targets
- Auto z-aim aiming at monster feet
- Do not slow crushers when crushing non-solid objects (eg. medikits)
- Map fail to load when linedef does not have front sidedef (!)
- Do not `console.warn()` when triggering known linedef types
- Delayed sprite rotation at low framerates (< 5fps)
- Monster moving when they start in a sector with low ceiling
- Missiles skimming the ground instead of exploding when they hit trees
- Linedef type 53 choosing wrong neighbour sector
- Numerous sound fixes:
    - Stop crackling/popping on sound playback
    - Adjustable max channels
    - Replace distance sounds with closer sounds
